[00:00.00]Instrumental Intro...
[00:05.00]Woke up this morning, feeling kind of bright
[00:10.00]Sun was shining, skies were blue and light
[00:15.00]Put on my shoes, stepped into the day
[00:20.00]Something in the air said it's gonna be okay
[00:25.00]Oh oh oh, yeah it's gonna be okay
[00:30.00]Mmm hmm hmm, just another golden day
[00:35.00]Life rolls on like a runaway train
[00:40.00]Smile on my face, singing in the rain
